### ðŸ”¸Problem Statement

The success of any retail store depends upon its sales. 
In a fast paced market, it is imperative to understand trends such as fast or slow moving products, impact of store type, and more. 
In order to strategize their business models, store owners rely heavily on past data to predict future sales, this is where the value of regression modeling can be utilized.

Build a supervised learning regression model to predict the sales of the store.

### ðŸ”¸My Approach

I utilised the concept of Object Oriented Programming to organise my code and maximise reusability. I created 2 classes: one for common functionalities that include data visualisation and data preprocessing, and the second, for model building and obtaining best performing model based on MSE, RMSE and r2 scores. 

Linear Regression, SVC and Decision tree regressor were the Supervised machine learning models used in this project. In addition, i used ensemble techniques such as XGBoost Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Stacking Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor as well. 

The best model obtained is the XGBoost Regressor.
